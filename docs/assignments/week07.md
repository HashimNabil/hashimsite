## **Multimeter (Amal Ashoor)**

In this week group assignment,I used to measure the voltage of the board using the multimeter, by connecting the black and red ends to the board GND and the VCC, repectively. As you can see, the voltage is around 5V when the button is pressed. However, it become 0V when the button is released.
