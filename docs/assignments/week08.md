# 8. Computer controlled machining



## **Amal Ashoor**
I chose to examine the fitting feature for the ShopBot machine. I designed four pieces using Fusion 360, where three are female and a single male. The male piece has a 40 mm pocket while the females have 39.6, 39.8, and 40 mm. I set the following cutting settings in the VCarved software to cut 12 mm plywood.

The female with a 40 mm pocket fits the male piece perfectly, as shown below.

## **Yousif Jalil**
 For the group assignment I choose the slot to test the machine,
 so I sketched the slot and then cut it with the shopbot machine<br>
 As seen in the sketch one of the slots has width of 12mm while the other has width of 11.8mm this is to test the which is more tighter fit.
