## **Amal Ashoor**

I chose Sorta-clear 37 Silicon Mold rubber for the mold and Task 4 Urethane Casting Resin for the cast. Thus, I read the safety data sheet for the mold and cast materials.

Sorta-clear 37 Silicon Mold contained no hazardous ingredients in both parts A and B. When storing this material, we should keep it closed tightly with a clear label in a  cool, dry, and well-ventilated place. There is no respiratory protection needed while using this material in open environments with adequate ventilation. However, there is a need to wear liquid-tight gloves and goggles. Also, extra protective clothing is not a necessity. It is highly recommended to have good personal hygiene after handling the material.

Task 4 Urethane Casting Resin part A is classified as dangerous that can cause skin and eye irritation and asthma symptom if inhaled. Thus, air-purifying respirators are needed. Also, there is a need to wear liquid-tight gloves and goggles. Moreover, extra protective clothing and good personal hygiene are recommended. On the other hand, part B contained no hazardous ingredients.

While using both materials above, I wore a lab coat, safety goggles, mask, and gloves.

**Safety First:** se in a properly ventilated area (“room size” ventilation). Wear safety glasses, long sleeves and rubber gloves to minimize contamination risk. Wear vinyl gloves only. Latex gloves will inhibit the cure of the rubber. [www.smooth-on.com](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/sorta-clear-37/)
