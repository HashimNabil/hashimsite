# 9. Embedded programming


## Group assignment:
    Compare the performance and development workflows for other architectures


## **Amal Ashoor**

I used  three different tools that depend on the C++ programming language to program the board, as shown in the assignment page. These tools are Arduino IDE software, ArduBlock, and PlatformIO IDE, where their advantages and disadvantages stated below.

1. Arduino IDE software
Advantages: 
 a. It is an open-source and cross-platform IDE. 
 b. Have a huge community and tutorials to learn from.
 c. Easy to install and use.
Disadvantages:
 a. Doesn't include a debugger.


2. ArduBlock
Advantages: 
 a. Easy to install and use.
 b. No previous knowledge in coding needed.
 c. Recommended to use by beginners.
Disadvantages:
 a. Doesnâ€™t covers all the libraries in Arduino IDE.  
 b. Only used as a part of Arduino IDE.
 
 
3. PlatformIO IDE
Advantages: 
 a. It is an open-source and cross-platform IDE.
 b. Use different programming languages including java and C.
 c. Has a huge community and tutorials to learn from.
 d. Contains a serial monitor and a debugging channel.
Disadvantages:
 a. More Complex than Arduino IDE.
